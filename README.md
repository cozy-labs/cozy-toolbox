## What is Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy](https://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space. With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.

## Cozy-Toolbox

Cozy-Toolbox is a web application that can be used to manage instances and
develop in local. It is a mix of the cloudery, bender, fauxton and other apps.
It can be used to browse the data in CouchDB, create local instances, or run
a fake OIDC server.

## How to start?
